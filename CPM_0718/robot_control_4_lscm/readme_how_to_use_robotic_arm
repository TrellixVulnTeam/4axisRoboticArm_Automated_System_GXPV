How to perform robotic arm's manipulation task.

1. enter 'Test_20161122/robot_control_gui_Release' folder and run 'run_4A_tegra'.(I do not need to share it with you, since you have got this folder on your TK1)
   when opening FourAxisRobotControlGUI, click 'VS Start' button to start sharememory communication module.

2. enter 'robcontrol_new' folder and perform 'sudo python test_RC_zx.py', which will guide robotic arm to move.

Calibration Tool

enter 'zhzCalib4Axis/CameraCalibrate_zx' folder and find 'zhz_find_CB_new.py', which is a script for generating mapping matrix between real robotic coordinates and image space coordinates.
